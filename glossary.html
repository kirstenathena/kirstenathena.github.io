    <h1>Plan Shopping Glossary: Words to Know</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of terms you will see and hear when choosing your health plan. These terms may be new to you. Learning them will help you better understand your health insurance.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="glossary">
    <div>
      <h2>C</h2>
      <h3>Co-insurance</h3>
      <p>If a health care service has co-insurance, you pay a
        percentage (part) of the cost for that service. Usually, you
        start to pay co-insurance after you meet your deductible.
        It is not a fixed cost like a co-pay. The amount you pay
        depends on the total cost of the service.</p>
      <h3>Co-pay</h3>
      <p>A fixed price you pay when you get certain health care services. Not all services require a co-pay.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>D</h2>
      <h3>Deductible</h3>
      <p> The total amount you must pay in a plan year before
        your plan will pay for part or all of your services. Some
        services may not have a deductible. They may be free
        or just have a co-pay, even though you haven't met the
        deductible yet.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>H</h2>
      <h3>Health care services</h3>
      <p> Health care services are things like going to the doctor,
        getting a prescription filled, or having an operation.</p>
      <h3>HMO</h3>
      <p>HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization. If you
        choose a plan that is an HMO, you must use in-network
        providers in order to get your services covered. If you go
        to an out-of-network provider, the plan wonâ€™t cover the
        cost of your care, except in an emergency.</p>
      <p> If you enroll in an HMO, you will also need to choose
        a primary care provider (PCP). You may need to get
        a referral from your PCP if you need care from specialists.
        Most of the plans offered through the Health Connector
        are HMOs. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>M</h2>
      <h3>Maximum out-of-pocket cost (MOOP)</h3>
      <p> The most you pay in one year for health care services.
        Once you pay this, your plan pays for all of your covered
        services for the rest of the year. You still need to pay your
        premium each month.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>P</h2>
      <h3>Plan Type</h3>
      <p> There are different ConnectorCare Plan Types that
        you may qualify for, based on your household size and
        income. All of the plans in each Play Type have the
        same costs for covered benefits.</p>
      <h3>Premium</h3>
      <p> The amount you pay each month for your health
        insurance. You must pay your premium every month,
        whether or not you use health care services. The
        Health Connector will send you a bill for your premium
        each month. The premium will always be due by the 23rd
        of the month.</p>
      <h3>Primary Care Physician (PCP)</h3>
      <p> The doctor who gives you health care and services,
        such as referrals to specialists. If you enroll in an HMO
        or EPO, you will need to choose a PCP.</p>
      <h3>Provider network</h3>
      <p> A provider network is a group of doctors, hospitals and
        other providers that works with the health plan to give
        you care. Each plan has a network. There are different
        types of networks. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>In-network</strong> means the provider is part of the health
          plan network. If you get care from an in-network
          provider, it will cost you less.</li>
        <li><strong>Out-of-network</strong> means the provider is not part of
          the health plan network. If you get care from an
          out-of-network provider, your plan may not pay for
          those services and you could have to pay all or
          part of the cost yourself.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>S</h2>
      <h3>Standardized Plans</h3>
      <p> We offer standardized plans within each metallic tier
        (level). Standardized plans have a set of 21 major
        benefits with the same out-of-pocket costs, to make
        them easier to compare. Non-standardized plans can
        have varying out-of-pocket costs for all benefits and are
        also offered within each metallic tier. If you see the word
        "Standard" in a plan name, it means that the benefits
        are standardized and the plan may be easier to compare
        with other standardized plans in the same metallic tier.</p>
